## Overview

Blockchain Digital Village is a decentralized platform built on Clarity smart contracts to manage participant profiles, track engagement, and provide secure access to personal data. The platform ensures privacy with granular access control, validation of participant data, and continuous tracking of platform activity. 

This system is ideal for communities and organizations seeking to implement a blockchain-based participant management solution with features like:
- Participant registration and profile management
- Interest-based tagging
- Engagement metrics tracking
- Role-based access control

## Features

- **Participant Registration**: Allows users to create and manage profiles with custom display names, personal statements, and interest tags.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including their display name, personal statement, and interests.
- **Access Control**: Detailed permissions allow users to control who can access their profiles and data.
- **Engagement Tracking**: Tracks user activity such as logins and interactions, providing engagement metrics for each participant.

## How It Works

### Smart Contract Data Structures:
- **Participant Registry**: Stores information about registered participants, including display names, account addresses, and interest tags.
- **Access Permissions**: Controls who has permission to view or modify participant data.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Records user activity, including visit counts and recent interactions.

### Functions:
- **Participant Registration**: The `create-participant-profile` and `register-new-participant` functions allow new users to join the platform, with validation on input data.
- **Profile Updates**: Functions like `modify-participant-interests` and `change-display-name` allow users to modify their profile data.
- **Engagement Logging**: Track participant activity with functions like `log-participant-activity` and `register-login-event`.
